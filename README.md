# spacefm plugins
my spacefm plugins (some in English, some in Dutch)

## description
In [collection.md](./collection.md) I've condensed the whole bunch into readable formats in [spacefm-plugins](./spacefm-plugins) each plugin has its own `.md` file with the title and the command of the plugin, and a directory. If there is no description provided in the plugin command's comment lines, then I hope the command itself is clear enough.

## Put your own plugins on your own github repository
For those who are interested I also put here the [bash script](_naarGitHub.sh) with which I filled this repository.

## to install
I'll have to check again, but since I just extracted all my spacefm plugins from their respective `.tar.gz` files, to put them in a readable format here on github, I'd suggest putting them back in individually to `.tar.gz`, and then you can import them into spacefm.
